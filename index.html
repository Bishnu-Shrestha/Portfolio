          <p>
            Hi, Iâ€™m Bishnu Shrestha, a passionate web developer with a strong
            aspiration to become a full-stack developer and an excellent
            front-end developer. I have recently completed my high schoole
            education in science stream, and I am proficient in HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, and am in process of learning React.
          </p>

          <p>
            Throughout my journey, I have created various projects, such as one
            piece website, book store website, which have helped me hone my
            skills and learn new technologies. I am creative, diligent, and
            always open to learning new things and gaining new experiences.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have had the opportunity to collaborate with diverse teams and
            individuals, which has enriched my understanding of teamwork and
            communication. My goal is to continue learning and growing in my
            career, and I am excited about the opportunities ahead.

          <h3>One Piece site:</h3>
          <p>
            I being a One Piece fan have created a website that has the origin
            of the manga and anime seried in the first part and in the second
            part there is the profile card of each of the straw hat pirats. This
            website contains some basic CSS animations as well. I learned most
            of my CSS from doing this project.
